                    <p>The U.S population has tripled during the 20th century and that can lead to many problems. Overpopulation can lead to a 6th mass extinction event that will shake the globe with problems. Fresh water is becoming less accessible and will obviously cripple the population of all species on earth. Our project will help spread awareness and raise money for helping non profits.One billion people were born in 12 years. The population of the entire world increased by that much between 1999 and 2011. Developing countries represent the largest areas of growth, and are where there are the fewest resources to support them.

                <p>Food Shortages</p>
                     <p>2.6 billion people around the world live on $2 a day or less and spend 60 to 80 per cent of their income on food.The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that the increase in food prices in 2007/08 meant 100 million more people could not afford food. A hundred million additional people were pushed into a situation of ‘food peril’</p>

                 <p>Deforestaion</p>
                     <p>If the current rate of deforestation continues, it will take less than 100 years to destroy all the rainforests on the earth.Up to 28,000 species are expected to become extinct by the next quarter of the century due to deforestation.</p>

                    <p>The government should inform the population that if this rate of population increase continues a chain of effects will be set in motion that will affect the entire world like acceleration of climate change, increase in air pollution,deforestation,etc</p>
